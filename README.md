# Description
To have the cellphone SMS notification that sends the link directly to you when it is in stock, you will need to find the sms address for your specific carrier. This can be found from https://www.comparecellular.ca/text-messaging/ 
Additionally, you will need a gmail account with app password enabled for the automated text notification. More detail on how to set this up can be found from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1IsCbXp0uE. Once that is setup, enter that information into the info.txt file and the program will automatically configure itself using that data.

This is specifically targeted for Canadian websites/users. This search bot can be setup to search 3060,3060ti, 3070, 3080, and 3090. Currently, it is only setup for Bestbuy but additional sites like newegg and memoryexpress will be added (Excluding Canada computers since they are not restocking due to the backlogged preorders).
