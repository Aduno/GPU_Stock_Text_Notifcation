# Description
To have the cellphone SMS notification, you will need to find the sms address for your specific carrier. This can be found from https://www.comparecellular.ca/text-messaging/ 
Additionally, you need a gmail account with app password enabled for the automated text notification. More detail on how to set this up can be found from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1IsCbXp0uE.

This is specifically targeted for Canadian websites/users. Currently, it only searches for 3060,3060ti, and 3070. It will be modified to allow selection of GPU search.
